# The claude.ai prototype

The first review queue was a single HTML page published as a private
claude.ai artifact (2026-09-25). A reference copy is in
[prototypes/review-queue.html](../prototypes/review-queue.html).

It showed 67 items the bot had compiled from the Workstream board,
fork PR bodies and analysis gists: decisions, reviews, actions and
credential/setting requests, each with a priority, an area, context, links,
and for decisions a list of options with one marked as recommended. For each
item you could pick an option, write a reply, or mark it done or deferred.

Its storage was the artifact runtime's hosted document store
(`window.claude.use("db")`): an `items` collection that the bot wrote with a
tool call, and a `replies` collection the page wrote (empty when this was
written).

## What it got right

- One screen of "things that need you", sorted by priority, with the
  question and the recommended option up front. That's the shape to keep.
- Decisions as explicit options, not free text, so answering takes one tap.
- A phone-friendly layout and plain-DOM rendering (no `innerHTML` for
  untrusted text).

## Why it is being replaced

- **A lookaside database.** Items and replies lived in a hosted store that
  is neither git nor markdown: no history, no diffs, no review, readable by
  the bot only through one vendor's tool, and invisible to every other
  tool. That's exactly what the source-of-truth principle rules out.
- **A copy, not a view.** The items were a snapshot compiled from the
  board and PRs, so they went stale as soon as the bot moved on, and a
  reply had to be copied back to the board by hand or by another job.
- **No forge actions.** It couldn't show a diff, edit a commit message,
  sign off or promote; those need the forge's API with your own identity.
- **Tied to one host.** It only worked inside claude.ai, so it could never
  serve the personal Forgejo.

The replacement keeps the queue's shape but reads it from markdown files in
a git repository and writes answers back as commits made as you; see
[design.md](design.md). The prototype's items map one-to-one onto that
format (`kind`, `priority`, `area`, `options`, `links`) and are migrated
with the board.
