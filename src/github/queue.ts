 *   (`replied`), then his again. Its priority is its board item's,
 *   found by the item id in its bot-meta section, else by Branch.
 * - Another PR of the bot's (`others`) is listed as classifyPr found it:
 *   what he is asked to do on it, or waiting on the bot. Its priority is
 *   its board item's, by Branch; In Review items (`linked`) count too.
 * - A Draft board item tracking a forge PR is that PR's entry, never a
 *   second one, and so is a Draft or Needs human item tracking another
 *   PR that waits on him: its asks nest under the PR (a Draft one is
 *   never listed apart, even while the PR waits on the bot: a Draft is
 *   ready for his review, and there is nothing to review then). A board item that
 *   is the listed PR itself is never a second entry either (bot-land
 *   puts the bot's own PRs on the board as themselves), unless it is
 *   Needs human while the PR waits on the bot: that is the bot bug the
 *   item flags. A Draft item whose Branch holds only forge PRs, none of
 *   them open and waiting, is stale (promoted or closed) and dropped.
 * - A board item whose own issue or PR is closed or merged is done,
 *   whatever its Status still says (see staleItems), and dropped; asks
 *   are the exception, listed as settled.
 * - Ask issues in the tracker (questions, reviews, chores) are listed by
 *   kind: settled (listed last) once he commented after the bot
 *   (`answered`, by node id) or the bot closed them. One whose blocked
 *   item (its parent issue, else its `Blocks:` URL) is also listed is
 *   nested under that entry rather than listed twice.
 * - Other board items are items: a Draft one (a gist to read), or a
 *   Needs human one, which should have open asks nested under it; one
 *   without is flagged as a bot bug.
 *
 * Until the forge has been read once (`forgeKnown`), nothing is stale:
 * forge-only Draft items are listed as items rather than dropped.
