// The poll loop: one poll at a time, the next one scheduled when it
// settles, paused while the tab is hidden, slowed or paused by the rate
// budget. A poll that never settles must not end the loop: after a
// stall timeout it is given up on and the loop goes on without it. And
// the loop says why the data on screen is getting old (pollNote), so a
// paused or stuck loop shows as such rather than as a quiet "cached".
//
// A page can also be suspended without its timers firing (mobile Safari
// in the background, the back-forward cache), so waking it (shown,
// restored or focused) checks the loop: a poll from before the
// suspension is given up on, and stale data is re-read at once.
//
// Kept apart from main.ts, with the poll and visibility injected, so
// tests can drive it with fake timers.
