// Whose turn a PR is: the bot's PRs other than the forge's drafts
// (upstream, in its own repositories and in the forge's own) are in his
// queue only for what he alone can do on them, read from GitHub itself
// rather than from tracker asks:
//
// - his review is requested (GitHub drops the request once he reviews,
//   so a PR he reviewed leaves the queue until the bot asks again);
// - upstream DCO fails on commits that lack his sign-off: approving the
//   head is what lets `bot-pr signoff` add it;
// - a required check failed, and rerunning it needs a maintainer;
// - the bot pushed or replied since he requested changes.
//
// A PR where he requested changes and the bot hasn't pushed or replied
// since is the bot's turn: listed apart, never as his. Pure functions
// over REST JSON, so tests feed them synthetic payloads.
